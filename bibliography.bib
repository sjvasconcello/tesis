   abstract = {quanteda is an R package providing a comprehensive workflow and toolkit for natural language processing tasks such as corpus management, tokenization, analysis, and vi-sualization. It has extensive functions for applying dictionary analysis, exploring texts using keywords-in-context, computing document and feature similarities, and discovering multi-word expressions through collocation scoring. Based entirely on sparse operations, it provides highly efficient methods for compiling document-feature matrices and for manipulating these or using them in further quantitative analysis. Using C++ and multi-threading extensively, quanteda is also considerably faster and more efficient than other R and Python packages in processing large textual data. The package is designed for R users needing to apply natural language processing to texts, from documents to final analysis. Its capabilities match or exceed those provided in many end-user software applications, many of which are expensive and not open source. The package is therefore of great benefit to researchers, students, and other analysts with fewer financial resources. While using quanteda requires R programming knowledge, its API is designed to enable powerful, efficient analysis with a minimum of steps. By emphasizing consistent design, furthermore, quanteda lowers the barriers to learning and using NLP and quantitative text analysis even for proficient R programmers. Corpus management quanteda makes it easy to manage texts in the form of a "corpus", which is defined as a collection of texts that includes document-level variables specific to each text, as well as meta-data for documents and for the collection as a whole. With the package, users can easily segment texts by words, paragraphs, sentences, or even user-supplied delimiters and tags, group them into larger documents by document-level variables, or subset them based on logical conditions or combinations of document-level variables.},

   abstract = {Much work has been done on the statistical analysis of text. In some cases reported in the literature , inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed. In particular, asymptotic normality assumptions have often been used unjustifiably, leading to flawed results. This assumption of normal distribution limits the ability to analyze rare events. Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text. However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical. This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text.},

   abstract = {The studies reported here are part of a research program whose purpose is to increase the effectiveness with which students acquire knowledge from written instructional materials. The studies had both a basic and an applied objective. The basic objective was to obtain evidence upon which to base a theory of the processes involved in language comprehension. The correlations between a large number of linguistic features and a measure of the difficulty students exhibited in comprehending the written language samples in which those features occurred were determined. The number of linguistic features which can be conceptualized numbers in the hundreds, most of which must be regarded as potentially representing a stimulus involved in the comprehension processes, because present theory of comprehension is too primitive to permit the authors to identify or to rule out more than a few of those features. The applied objective was to develop regression formulas for estimating if instructional materials are suitable for students of varying levels of language comprehension ability. These readability formulas provide a partial solution to the problem of fitting materials to students. That is, students may be provided with materials suited to their levels of comprehension ability not only by manipulating the materials rto make them suitably understandable but also by selecting and using just those materials which are suited to the students' comprehension ability.

   abstract = {The word2vec model and application by Mikolov et al. have attracted a great amount of attention in recent two years. The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models. This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter update equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations. In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of the model. 1 1 Continuous Bag-of-Word Model 1.1 One-word context We start from the simplest version of the continuous bag-of-word model (CBOW) introduced in Mikolov et al. (2013a). We assume that there is only one word considered per context, which means the model will predict one target word given one context word, which is like a bigram model. For readers who are new to neural networks, it is recommended that one go through Appendix A for a quick review of the important concepts and terminologies before proceeding further. Figure 1 shows the network model under the simplified context definition 2. In our setting, the vocabulary size is V , and the hidden layer size is N.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Semantic similarity and clustering can be utilized efficiently for generating effective summary of large text collections. Summarizing large volume of text is a challenging and time consuming problem particularly while considering the semantic similarity computation in summarization process. Summarization of text collection involves intensive text processing and computations to generate the summary. MapReduce is proven state of art technology for handling Big Data. In this paper, a novel framework based on MapReduce technology is proposed for summarizing large text collection. The proposed technique is designed using semantic similarity based clustering and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for summarizing the large text collection over MapReduce framework. The summarization task is performed in four stages and provides a modular implementation of multiple documents summarization. The presented technique is evaluated in terms of scalability and various text summarization parameters namely, compression ratio, retention ratio, ROUGE and Pyramid score are also measured. The advantages of MapReduce framework are clearly visible from the experiments and it is also demonstrated that MapReduce provides a faster implementation of summarizing large text collections and is a powerful tool in Big Text Data analysis.},

   abstract = {Question-answering (QA) is a significant application of Large Language Models (LLMs), shaping chatbot capabilities across healthcare, education, and customer service. However, widespread LLM integration presents a challenge for small businesses due to the high expenses of LLM API usage. Costs rise rapidly when domain-specific data (context) is used alongside queries for accurate domain-specific LLM responses. One option is to summarize the context by using LLMs and reduce the context. However, this can also filter out useful information that is necessary to answer some domain-specific queries. In this paper, we shift from human-oriented summarizers to AI model-friendly summaries. Our approach, LeanContext, efficiently extracts $k$ key sentences from the context that are closely aligned with the query. The choice of $k$ is neither static nor random; we introduce a reinforcement learning technique that dynamically determines $k$ based on the query and context. The rest of the less important sentences are reduced using a free open source text reduction method. We evaluate LeanContext against several recent query-aware and query-unaware context reduction approaches on prominent datasets (arxiv papers and BBC news articles). Despite cost reductions of $37.29\%$ to $67.81\%$, LeanContext's ROUGE-1 score decreases only by $1.41\%$ to $2.65\%$ compared to a baseline that retains the entire context (no summarization). Additionally, if free pretrained LLM-based summarizers are used to reduce context (into human consumable summaries), LeanContext can further modify the reduced context to enhance the accuracy (ROUGE-1 score) by $13.22\%$ to $24.61\%$.},

   abstract = {Resumen-La tarea de un diseÃ±ador de procesos de ETL involucra: (1) analizar las fuentes de datos existentes para encontrar la semÃ¡ntica oculta en ellas y (2) diseÃ±ar el flujo de trabajo que extraiga los datos desde las fuentes, repare sus inconsistencias, los transforme en un formato deseado, y, finalmente, los inserte en la bodega de datos. Con el propÃ³sito de facilitar esta tarea, se han desarrollado diferentes tÃ©cnicas, dos categorÃ­as que sobresalen son: (a) Las inspiradas en los diagramas de flujo y de procesos y (b) las inspiradas en el paradigma de programaciÃ³n orientada a objetos (POO) y los diagramas de UML. En el presente artÃ­culo se expone un par de alternativas halladas en la literatura y se ilustra la tÃ©cnica utilizada en el proyecto "Desarrollo de una soluciÃ³n de inteligencia de negocios para apoyar a la toma de decisiones en el Proyecto CÃ­rculos de Aprendizaje", explicando el porquÃ© de su elecciÃ³n y cÃ³mo se usÃ³.

Abstract-The task of a designer ETL process involves: (1) analyzing existing data sources to find the semantics hidden in them and (2) design workflow that extracts data from sources, repair its inconsistencies, transforms it into a desired format, and finally inserted into the data warehouse. In order to facilitate this task, different techniques have been developed, two categories that stand out are: (a) inspired flow diagrams and process and (b) those based on the paradigm of object-oriented programming (OOP) and diagrams in UML. This article presents a couple of alternatives found in the literature and illustrates the technique used in the project "Development of a business intelligence solution to support decision making in the Learning Circles Project," explaining why of their choice and how it was used Key Word-Business Intelligence, Data Warehouse, Data Staging Area, ETL Process. I. INTRODUCCIÃN El proceso de extracciÃ³n, transformaciÃ³n y carga-ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Load) es una de las actividades tÃ©cnicas mÃ¡s crÃ­ticas en el desarrollo de soluciones de inteligencia de negocios-BI (Business Intelligence) [1][2]. Hace parte del componente de integraciÃ³n y, de su implementaciÃ³n adecuada dependen la integridad, uniformidad, consistencia y disponibilidad de los datos utilizados en el componente de anÃ¡lisis de una soluciÃ³n de BI. Su funciÃ³n es extraer, limpiar, transformar, resumir, y formatear los datos que se almacenarÃ¡n en la bodega de datos de la soluciÃ³n de BI [3][4][5]. La construcciÃ³n del ETL puede dividirse en tres subprocesos o componentes: componente de extracciÃ³n, componente de transformaciÃ³n y componente de carga. En la Tabla 1 se presenta la descripciÃ³n de cada uno de estos componentes identificando los elementos objetivo, las operaciones realizadas, y los resultados esperados.},
